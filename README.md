This task view contains information about mapping and visualizing
spatial data in R. The base version of R does not ship with many tools
for mapping spatial data. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large
number of tools for doing so. A list of available packages and functions
is presented below, grouped by the type of activity. If you have any
comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this taskview,
go to Github and [submit an
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/issues), or [make some
changes](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/pulls). If
you can't contribute on Github, [send Jeff an
email](mailto:hollister.jeff@epa.gov). If you have an issue with one of
the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that
package.
